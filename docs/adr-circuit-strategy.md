# Circuit Strategy

## What strategies are we analyzing?

- Separable
- 2-Qubit
- Loop with different sizes
- All-to-all

## Why?
To answer the following questions:
- How does the number of interactions change the metric values?
- Which strategy is better regarding the metric?
- Can we reduce the number of interactions in the circuit and be still "good" regarding the metric?
