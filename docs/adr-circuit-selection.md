# Circuit Selection

## What circuits are we analyzing?

- Circuit 2
- Circuit 3
- Circuit 6
- Circuit 9

## Why?
- Circuit 2 and Circuit 3 are circuits of type nearest-neighbor. They are similar but different according to the two qubit interaction type (CNOT vs CRZ)
- Circuit 6 is a circuit of type all-to-all
- Circuit 9 has the highest entanglement
